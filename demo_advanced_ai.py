        Anti-Money Laundering Policy for Financial Institutions
        
        Purpose:
        This policy establishes the framework for detecting, preventing, and reporting money laundering activities.
        
        Scope:
        This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and agents of the financial institution.
        
        Requirements:
        1. All transactions over $10,000 must be reported to the authorities.
        2. Customer due diligence must be performed for all new accounts.
        3. Suspicious activity must be reported within 30 days of detection.
        4. Employee training on AML procedures must be completed annually.
        5. Records must be maintained for at least 5 years.
        
        Risk Categories:
        - High-risk transactions include cash deposits over $10,000
        - High-risk customers include politically exposed persons (PEPs)
        - High-risk jurisdictions include countries with inadequate AML controls
        
        Compliance Guidelines:
        - Monitor for structuring patterns (multiple transactions just below reporting thresholds)
        - Verify customer identity through government-issued identification
        - Implement enhanced due diligence for high-risk customers
        - Report suspicious transactions to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)
