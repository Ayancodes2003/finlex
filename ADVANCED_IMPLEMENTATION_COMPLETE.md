# FinLex Platform - Advanced Implementation Complete

## Summary

The advanced implementation of the FinLex platform has been successfully completed. All AI features are now fully functional with your Gemini API key.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Environment Variable Configuration**: Added GEMINI_API_KEY to docker-compose.yml to ensure all services can access the API key
2. **Gemini Model Updates**: Updated all services from deprecated "gemini-pro" to current "gemini-1.5-pro-latest" model
3. **Missing Dependencies**: Added python-multipart dependency to policy-extractor service to enable file upload functionality
4. **Service Rebuild and Restart**: Rebuilt and restarted all services to apply the changes

## Current Status

✅ All services are running and accessible
✅ AI functionality is working correctly
✅ Gemini API integration is successful
✅ Platform is ready for advanced compliance monitoring

## Services Overview

| Service | Port | Status | Description |
|---------|------|--------|-------------|
| API Gateway | 18000 | ✅ Running | Central API routing |
| Transaction Ingest | 18001 | ✅ Running | Process and analyze transactions |
| Policy Extractor | 18002 | ✅ Running | Extract and analyze compliance policies |
| Compliance Matcher | 18003 | ✅ Running | Match transactions against policies |
| RAG Generator | 18004 | ✅ Running | Generate compliance reports |
| Vector DB | 18010 | ✅ Running | Store policy embeddings |
| Redis | 16379 | ✅ Running | Caching layer |
| PostgreSQL | 15432 | ✅ Running | Transaction storage |
| Nginx | 13000 | ✅ Running | Reverse proxy |

## Key AI Endpoints

### Transaction Ingest Service (http://localhost:18001)
- POST `/transactions` - Add a new transaction
- POST `/analyze/{transaction_id}` - AI analysis of transaction
- POST `/upload` - Upload CSV transaction data

### Policy Extractor Service (http://localhost:18002)
- POST `/policies` - Add a new policy
- POST `/analyze/{policy_id}` - AI analysis of policy
- POST `/upload` - Upload policy documents

### Compliance Matcher Service (http://localhost:18003)
- POST `/scan` - Check transactions for compliance violations

### RAG Generator Service (http://localhost:18004)
- POST `/generate` - Generate compliance reports

## Testing the Platform

You can verify the platform is working by running:

```bash
# Test basic service health
curl http://localhost:18001/health
curl http://localhost:18002/health
curl http://localhost:18003/health
curl http://localhost:18004/health

# Run comprehensive tests
python test_actual_endpoints.py
python test_ai_analysis.py
```

## Using the Platform

1. **Add Policies**: Use the Policy Extractor service to add compliance policies
2. **Process Transactions**: Use the Transaction Ingest service to add and analyze transactions
3. **Check Compliance**: Use the Compliance Matcher to identify violations
4. **Generate Reports**: Use the RAG Generator to create detailed compliance reports

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check service status: `docker-compose ps`
2. View service logs: `docker-compose logs <service-name>`
3. Restart services: `docker-compose restart`
4. Rebuild services: `docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d`

## Next Steps

The FinLex platform is now ready for production use. You can:

1. Integrate with your existing financial systems
2. Add more sophisticated compliance policies
3. Customize the AI analysis prompts for your specific requirements
4. Set up automated compliance scanning
5. Configure alerting for high-risk violations
